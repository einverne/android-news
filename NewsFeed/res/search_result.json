title: "Google Fights Back in China",
text: "Two giants on the world stage are battling over the future of information. One is an authoritarian regime suppressing access to modern technology. The other is an information company fighting back without support from its home country. The conflict between China and Google is shaping up as the first war of the digital era. Google recently launched a pair of counterattacks, last week informing Gmail account holders when "state-sponsored attackers" compromise their emails. Gmail users get this pop-up message: "Warning: We believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer. Protect yourself now." Users are told how to do so, including with a new login process. Google explained that its engineers "are constantly on the lookout for malicious activity," especially unauthorized access to accounts. "You might ask how we know this activity is state-sponsored," said a Google blog post. "We can't go into the details without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors, but our detailed analysis〞as well as victim reports〞strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are state-sponsored." In 2010, Google exposed Beijing for breaking into the Gmail accounts of rights activists and others, and it fought back by routing searches to uncensored Hong Kong. Tufts professor Daniel Drezner half-joked on his blog that being included in this warning will become a bragging right "that wonks inside and outside the Beltway will use to measure their 'influence.'" But the warnings were ominous to China-based journalists and dissidents who were among the first Gmail account holders to report getting them. This follows a move by Google last month to alert its users in China when they enter one of hundreds of search terms that leads government censors to cut off access. These include the names of Communist Party officials, "prisoner of the state" and "freedom." Users in China get this pop-up warning: "Please note that in mainland China, searching for the character '[xxx]' might cause the link between the user and Google to be temporarily cut off. The cutoff is not in Google's control." By disclosing details about censorship inside China to Chinese users, Google is intentionally embarrassing Beijing. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt spoke about risks to the Internet at a recent conference at the London Science Museum. "While threats come from individuals and even groups of people, the biggest problem will be activities stemming from nations that seek to do harm," he said. China is the superpower of censorship, spending more on domestic security, including monitoring what Chinese people do on the Web, than it spends on its military. The Obama administration has told Google that the company is on its own, failing even to bring international trade cases against Beijing for suppressing global communications technologies. Google could escalate further by spending a few hundred million dollars to offer circumvention tools so that Chinese users can reach the Web outside China. Some critics in business and politics wonder why Google would challenge China, especially since Google has lost about half its market share in the country. David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, answered the question in 2010 when the company first exposed Beijing's online activities: "It is good for our business to push for free expression." China is the un-Google. It is enforcing a regulation requiring Chinese citizens who use the local equivalents of Facebook and Twitter to use their real names. This is intended to intimidate users and help domestic security forces spot troublemakers. This month, Beijing suppressed information about the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and crackdown by blocking Web searches. This went so far as to block searches for the closing price of the Shanghai Composite, the country's leading stock index, when it happened to fall 64.89 points on the anniversary date〞numbers often used as code in China for June 4, 1989. Meanwhile, Chinese officials last week demanded that the U.S. Embassy stop posting online updates on the level of air pollution in Beijing. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "We believe that this type of information should not be released to the public." Governments that stifle information lose the benefit of the doubt with their own people. Tiananmen Square protester Li Wangyang, who was jailed and tortured for more than 20 years, last week was found dead in a hospital. Authorities claim he hanged himself, but photos posted online show his feet on the ground. China's leaders should keep in mind that this is the kind of authoritarian abuse and lack of accountability that helped spark the Arab Spring. Even Beijing may not be able to suppress information forever. Chen Guangcheng, the blind legal activist who took refuge in the U.S. Embassy and was eventually allowed to come to the U.S., last week told the Council on Foreign Relations: "I think even over the last few years as the Information Age has developed so quickly, China's society has gotten to the era where if you don't want something known, you better not do it."

title: "Google Unveils New Search Mechanism in China",
text: "BEIJING〞Google Inc. has begun notifying Chinese users when they are using search terms that can trigger China's Internet blocks, in its boldest challenge in two years to Beijing's efforts to restrict online content. The Internet search giant unveiled on its Chinese search site this week a new mechanism that identifies political and other sensitive terms that are censored by Chinese authorities. For example, when users search for keywords like "carrot"〞which contains the character for Chinese President Hu Jintao's surname〞a yellow dropdown message says: "We've observed that searching for 'hu' in mainland China may temporarily break your connection to Google. This interruption is outside Google's control." The Internet giant acknowledged on its official blog Thursday that users in China are having trouble accessing its services, saying failed searches can impair performance on the site. "Users are regularly getting error messages like 'This webpage is not available' or 'The connection was reset,' " the post said. Google says it hopes the alerts "will help improve the search experience in mainland China," where Google's search and other services have been unstable since it entered a public spat with Chinese authorities over censorship over two years ago. A Google spokesman declined to comment further. Chinese officials don't discuss their Internet restrictions, and its search terms are treated as state secrets. In its post, Google said the trigger terms were identified based on reviews of the outcomes of the 350,000 most popular search queries in China, not an official list. The post doesn't mention censorship or explicitly say Chinese authorities are the cause of the blocks. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said at a regular press briefing Friday that "there are more than 500 million Internet users in China, and they have access to plenty of information...Like other countries, China also administers its Internet according to law." China's restrictions include the names of top leaders as well as high-profile dissidents like blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng and references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and crackdown. The move is the most significant Google has made related to China's Internet restrictions since early 2010, when it publicly said it wouldn't adhere to China's censorship policies and said it might have to shut down its Google.cn China site as well as its offices there. Google ultimately kept its China offices but moved its Web search and other services to Hong Kong, where it doesn't have to comply with regulations in mainland China. But the move has led to occasionally spotty service. As a result, Google has been losing market share in China, according to research firm Analysys International, which estimates the company had a 17% share of search revenue in the country in the first quarter, down from 36% in the fourth quarter of 2009, though company executives have said their revenue is still growing. In comparison, Google's largest Chinese rival, Baidu Inc., had a 79% share in the first quarter. Still, Google has expanded its operations within the country, adding engineers and sales staff to work on other products, including its Android mobile operating system and services that don't require official censorship, such as e-commerce. Analysts say Google's latest move could jeopardize some of Google's recent efforts. "It does seem like a move that would be perceived as antagonistic by Chinese Internet authorities," said Jeremy Goldkorn, director of Danwei.com, which researches Chinese media and Internet. Currently, companies such as Baidu and the Web portal operated by Sina Corp. offer users a note saying some search results can't be displayed because of local rules and other issues, but they don't specify which terms might have fallen afoul of censors. On Friday, a number of Chinese Internet users appeared confused by Google's move. "Has Google also started to 'harmonize' sensitive words?" wrote a user on Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like microblogging site, going by the name Chester_Hahn, using a term often used in China to mock censorship. Others joked about it. "Google, you are trying to flip someone's miniskirt up again! You bad boy," wrote one user by the name Xi Gang. Another called Jiu Xian said, "Poor carrot. You are shot even when you have nothing to do with anything sensitive. You are so unlucky to share the same surname, Hu, with our beloved president." Write to Loretta Chao at loretta.chao@wsj.com",

title: "Google Says It Will Shut China Music Service",
text: "Google Inc. said Friday it will close a music download service in China, further reducing its presence in the world's most populous Internet market two years after the company closed its mainland search engine in a dispute over censorship and computer hacking. Google said the 3-year-old service failed to achieve the market impact it wanted and will be shut down Oct. 19. The service, which was available only to computers with an Internet address in mainland China, was intended as a legal alternative to Chinese pirate music sites. It shared advertising revenues with global and Chinese music companies that have seen their potential sales undercut by rampant unlicensed copying. "The impact of this product is not as great as we expected, so we decided to shift resources to other products," said an announcement on Google's company blog. A Google spokesman said he could not provide information about revenues or the service's number of users. Google's share of China's search market has dwindled but the company says it still makes money selling advertising on its global sites to Chinese customers. Google's Android mobile phone operating system also is widely used in China. Google, based in Mountain View, California, closed its mainland search engine in China in 2010 after saying it no longer wanted to cooperate with Beijing's Internet censorship following hacking attacks traced to China. In June, the company added a feature to warn users whose accounts it believes are targets of "state-sponsored attacks." Mainland Web surfers can use Google's Chinese-language search engine in Hong Kong, which is Chinese territory but has Western-style civil liberties. However, the communist government's Internet filters make access slow. In May, the Hong Kong search site added a feature that warns users in China who enter search keywords that might produce blocked results. The move had the potential to irritate Chinese authorities who try to conceal their efforts to control access to online material. Google had 15.7 percent of China's search market in the second quarter of the year, well behind local rival Baidu Inc., which had 78.6 percent, according to Analysys International, a research firm in Beijing. Another local rival, Sogou, was a distant third with 2.9 percent. Baidu launched a competing music download service last year. China's government promotes Internet use for business and education but tries to control what its people see online. The number of people online in China rose to 538 million as of the end of July, up 11 percent from a year earlier, according to an industry group, the China Internet Network Information Center. 〞〞〞 Google Inc.: www.google.com",

title: "Google Adds Feature to Help China Searchers",
text: "Google has fired a new salvo in a censorship battle with Beijing by adding a feature that warns users in China who enter search keywords that might produce blocked results and suggests they try other terms. Google's announcement Thursday described the change as a technical improvement and made no mention of Beijing's extensive Internet controls. But it comes after filters were tightened so severely in recent weeks that searches fail for some restaurants, universities or tourist information. Authorities were trying to stamp out talk about an embarrassing scandal over the fall of a rising Communist Party star. Google Inc. closed its China-based search engine in 2010 to avoid cooperating with government censorship. Mainland users can see its Chinese-language site in Hong Kong but the connection breaks if they search for sensitive terms. The new feature will alert users if they enter a search term that "may temporarily break your connection to Google," said a blog post by a Google senior vice president, Alan Eustace. He said it will suggest they "try other search terms." "By prompting people to revise their queries, we hope to reduce these disruptions and improve our user experience from mainland China," Eustace wrote. Google cited as an example the Chinese character "jiang," or river, without mentioning it is the name of former President Jiang Zemin, the possible reason results are blocked. It says the site will recommend removing the character. Google could anger Beijing by pointing out individual terms that might produce blocked results. Chinese regulators do not disclose which terms are banned. They try to hide censorship by returning the same error message as for a technical failure, possibly to avoid drawing attention to unwanted topics. A Google spokesman declined to comment on whether the company was concerned about Chinese government retaliation. Google was allowed to keep a network of advertising sales offices in China that might be vulnerable if the communist government tries to punish the company. Google, based in Mountain View, California, had 16.6 percent of China's search market in the first quarter based on use of its global and Hong Kong sites, according to Analysys International, a Beijing research firm. It was in second place behind local rival Baidu Inc., which 78.5 percent, but ahead of other Chinese competitors. Google is also promoting its Android mobile phone operating system for use by Chinese manufacturers. Beijing approved Google's $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a wireless device maker, last month on condition Android remains available to Chinese companies and others at no cost for five years. Tensions over censorship highlight Beijing's complicated relations with global technology companies. The communist government wants to boost incomes by promoting high-tech industry but insists on controlling access to information. Beijing promotes Internet use for education and business and has the world's biggest population of Internet users, with 513 million people online as of December, but tries to block politically sensitive material. The latest tightening of controls was prompted by a flurry of rumors online about the downfall of Bo Xilai, a prominent politician who was party secretary of the major city of Chongqing in the southwest. In addition to Bo's name, blocked terms include Chongqing and Yangtze River, which flows past the city. That means searches for universities, hotels, restaurants or other businesses that use those names also fail. China's two most popular microblog services stopped allowing new postings for three days in early April to erase what they said were illegal or harmful postings. Google's engineers reviewed the 350,000 most popular search queries in China in an effort to find "disruptive queries," the company said. Google gave no indication when development of the latest feature started but said it received reports of unreliable searches "over the past couple of years."",

text: "BEIJING: Google's Android operating system runs two-thirds of the smartphones sold in China yet the company's online app store, Google Play, isn't open for business there because of censorship concerns. That's creating an opportunity for China Mobile. The world's biggest phone company by subscribers opened its Mobile Market store for Android apps in 2009, and it now has 158 million registered users. Customers have downloaded more than 630 million apps, making Mobile Market the world's largest carrier-operated app store, said Jack Kent of IHS Screen Digest. The success of Mobile Market comes at a welcome juncture for the wireless giant, fueling revenue growth as its core business matures. China Mobile competes with Apple's App Store in a nation where Analysys International said mobile applications and services are set to jump 80 per cent to 220 billion yuan ($35 billion) this year as cheaper smartphones make surfing the Web more affordable. "Without having to compete with the official Google store, China Mobile has an opportunity that operators in other countries don't have," said Kent, a London-based analyst. "China Mobile's relationship with subscribers leaves it well- placed to take advantage." The carrier's data services business, including Mobile Market, jumped 15 per cent last year to 139.3 billion yuan, compared with an 8.8 per cent growth in total sales. Facebook, Twitter Shipments of smartphones in China are projected to jump 52 per cent this year to 137 million units, overtaking the US for the first time as the world's biggest market, according to a March estimate from market researcher IDC. Phones running Android accounted for 68 per cent of sales in the fourth quarter, while Apple's iPhone made up 5.7 per cent, according to Beijing-based Analysys International. Apple's online store generated about $2.9 billion in global app sales last year, compared with about $618 million for Google, Kent estimated. "The reason we care about this business is that it can help drive or promote our other businesses," China Mobile's Chief Executive Officer Li Yue said in a May 16 interview. "If a developer makes a very good app, then it will help boost traffic on our network and help our growth that way." All web content in China is censored, and that control extends to online stores selling apps, games and e-books. Both Mobile Market and Apple's Chinese-language store, which takes payment in local currency, abide by government censorship restrictions and don't offer apps to access the blocked websites of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Google censorship Google said in January 2010 it was no longer willing to self-censor content for Chinese services, so it shuttered its local search page and redirected users to a Hong Kong site. Taj Meadows, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Google, declined to comment on why Google Play was unavailable in China. The store has more than 450,000 apps and games, the company said in March. China Mobile's store has 68,663 apps, compared with 560,957 for Apple, said Sun Peilin, a researcher at Analysys International. Mobile Market's offerings include Instagram Inc.'s photo-sharing and editing software, and Rovio Entertainment Oy's Angry Birds, Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Space. China Mobile's sales from applications and information services grew 12 per cent to 48.4 billion yuan last year, accounting for 9.2 per cent of total sales and overtaking text messages as the company's biggest source of data revenue. Drive traffic That total includes 22 billion yuan from mobile music, 1.5 billion yuan from mobile e-mail services, 627 million yuan from e-books and 571 million yuan from mobile videos, according to the company's annual report. Mobile Market has become the world's largest Chinese- language application software platform, Li said. Sales from the Mobile Market last year were about 23 million yuan, though the traffic generated by app downloads among China Mobile's 667.2 million mobile-phone subscribers is more important to the carrier, Li said. China Mobile is forecast to post its third straight year of sales growth after reporting revenue gains of at least 10 percent from the time of its 1997 Hong Kong listing through 2009. Sales growth may slow to 7 percent this year, according to the average of 31 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Unicom, Telecom China Mobile isn't the only local company looking to fill the Google gap for Android apps. Analysys International tracks 13 major app stores in China, including from carriers China Unicom (Hong Kong) and China Telecom, and device makers including Lenovo Group. "We see a lot of competition in the app store space in China," said Lisa Soh, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd. "The competition in app platforms is likely to mean it will be more difficult to monetize." One thing that may help China Mobile generate sales is that it offers the highest percentage of paid apps versus free apps among all stores in China, Sun said. Mobile Market charges for 91 per cent of its apps, while China Unicom charges for 77 per cent and Apple's for 48 per cent. Many games in China Mobile's shop are offered in local currency prices that range from the equivalent of 50 cents to $1.50. "A couple of years ago, everyone began to realize how huge Apple's App store was becoming and wanted into that market," said Neil Juggins, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JI Asia Research Ltd.",

The problem for Google users in China, and Google, is that whenever a user searched for a banned word not only would the search yield only an error message, but the connection to Google would be lost for a minute or so, which is highly inconvenient.

And now it is telling its users what those words are, in defiance of the Chinese government＊s policy of keeping them secret. But not too defiant. The tone of Eustace＊s blog could not have been smoother nor its references to censorship more roundabout. Google, it seems, does not want to upset Beijing too much. Perhaps that is because although the US company is pretty much out of the search engine market here, and the censors block or mess with all its products except Gmail, Google still has a big commercial interest in China. The firm is pushing its Android mobile phone operating system hard, and successfully, with Chinese handset manufacturers. Last month it won Beijing＊s approval for its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, a wireless device maker. Under those circumstances, it is probably best not to be too blunt when you are challenging the authorities. A polite smile to mask the knife thrust seems a wise idea.

title: "Google buys Motorola Mobility",
text: "?Google CEO Larry Page speaks during a press announcement at Google's headquarters in New York, May 21, 2012. Photograph by: Eduardo Munoz , Reuters Google Tuesday finalized its $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility, a key manufacturer of smartphones and other devices which puts the Internet giant in head-to-head competition with Apple. "The acquisition will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing," the California-based Internet giant said in a statement. "I'm happy to announce the deal has closed. Motorola is a great American tech company, with a track record of over 80 years of innovation," Google chief executive Larry Page said. "It's a great time to be in the mobile business, and I'm confident that the team at Motorola will be creating the next generation of mobile devices that will improve lives for years to come." The completion follows approval by Chinese, US and European regulators, amid concerns that Google would keep Android, a free operating system, out of the hands of competitors in the mobile device market. Conditions from China's Ministry of Commerce included Google keeping its Android software for gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers free and open for at least five years. Regulators in the US and elsewhere have stressed that they will be watching to make sure that the Mountain View, California-based company does not use its acquisition of Motorola Mobility to obtain unfair advantage in the market. Google will acquire 17,000 patents with the purchase of Motorola Mobility and has been strengthening its patent portfolio as the fight for dominance in the booming smartphone and tablet market increasingly involves lawsuits claiming infringement of patented technology. Apple and South Korea's Samsung, whose devices are powered by Google's Android software, are currently involved in lengthy and costly patent fights being waged on several continents. In announcing the Motorola Mobility acquisition in August, Page said it will "enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies." On Tuesday, Page said the deal offered exciting possibilities for Google, which until now has been focused mainly on software. "The phones in our pockets have become supercomputers that are changing the way we live," Page said. "It's now possible to do things we used to think were magic, or only possible on Star Trek--like get directions right from where we are standing; watch a video on YouTube; or take a picture and share the moment instantly with friends. Motorola Mobility was created in 2011 when US-based Motorola Inc. split the company into a mobile devices unit and a government and public safety division known as Motorola Solutions. Google said it will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business unit, which will be a licensee of Android, the Google operating system for mobile devices. "Android will remain open," the company said. Heading the unit will be "long-time Googler" Dennis Woodside, who will take over from Sanjay Jha, who led the company through this acquisition. Woodside, who has overseen integration planning for the acquisition, previously served as president of Google's Americas region. "Motorola literally invented the entire mobile industry with the first-ever commercial cell phone in 1983," Woodside said. "Thirty years later, mobile devices are at the centre of the computing revolution. Our aim is simple: to focus Motorola Mobility's remarkable talent on fewer, bigger bets, and create wonderful devices that are used by people around the world." ?? Copyright (c) AFP ? ? ?

text: "?Google CEO Larry Page speaks during a press announcement at Google's headquarters in New York, May 21, 2012. Photograph by: Eduardo Munoz , Reuters Google Tuesday finalized its $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility, a key manufacturer of smartphones and other devices which puts the Internet giant in head-to-head competition with Apple. "The acquisition will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing," the California-based Internet giant said in a statement. "I'm happy to announce the deal has closed. Motorola is a great American tech company, with a track record of over 80 years of innovation," Google chief executive Larry Page said. "It's a great time to be in the mobile business, and I'm confident that the team at Motorola will be creating the next generation of mobile devices that will improve lives for years to come." The completion follows approval by Chinese, US and European regulators, amid concerns that Google would keep Android, a free operating system, out of the hands of competitors in the mobile device market. Conditions from China's Ministry of Commerce included Google keeping its Android software for gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers free and open for at least five years. Regulators in the US and elsewhere have stressed that they will be watching to make sure that the Mountain View, California-based company does not use its acquisition of Motorola Mobility to obtain unfair advantage in the market. Google will acquire 17,000 patents with the purchase of Motorola Mobility and has been strengthening its patent portfolio as the fight for dominance in the booming smartphone and tablet market increasingly involves lawsuits claiming infringement of patented technology. Apple and South Korea's Samsung, whose devices are powered by Google's Android software, are currently involved in lengthy and costly patent fights being waged on several continents. In announcing the Motorola Mobility acquisition in August, Page said it will "enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies." On Tuesday, Page said the deal offered exciting possibilities for Google, which until now has been focused mainly on software. "The phones in our pockets have become supercomputers that are changing the way we live," Page said. "It's now possible to do things we used to think were magic, or only possible on Star Trek--like get directions right from where we are standing; watch a video on YouTube; or take a picture and share the moment instantly with friends. Motorola Mobility was created in 2011 when US-based Motorola Inc. split the company into a mobile devices unit and a government and public safety division known as Motorola Solutions. Google said it will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business unit, which will be a licensee of Android, the Google operating system for mobile devices. "Android will remain open," the company said. Heading the unit will be "long-time Googler" Dennis Woodside, who will take over from Sanjay Jha, who led the company through this acquisition. Woodside, who has overseen integration planning for the acquisition, previously served as president of Google's Americas region. "Motorola literally invented the entire mobile industry with the first-ever commercial cell phone in 1983," Woodside said. "Thirty years later, mobile devices are at the centre of the computing revolution. Our aim is simple: to focus Motorola Mobility's remarkable talent on fewer, bigger bets, and create wonderful devices that are used by people around the world." ?? Copyright (c) AFP ? ? ?
